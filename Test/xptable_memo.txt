There were a few bugs in v1.2.2 that broke when using group columns:
 - ColumnCollectionEditor didn't understand group columns, so you couldn't add them in the designer UI.

 - RowCollection.ExpandAllSubRows() would fail to expand rows correctly when group columns existed ('subrows'), and RowCollection.Clear didn't reset the _totalHiddenSubRows variable, causing the collection to think that there were negative visibile rows after clearing with subrows hidden.

 - Table has a scrollbar bug, secondary to having negative visible rows, that would cause infinite stack recursion when trying to update the scrollbar position in UpdateScrollBars(). visibleRowCount would be a negative number and so it would try to set the scrollbar position to a negative value. The scrollbar would see that it is setting a negative value, fix it up to zero, and then fire its changed event. UpdateScrollBars usually fires again, but normally it does nothing because it sets the scrollbar to a value that it is already, and so the next event doesn't fire and UpdateScrollBars doesn't run again, thus ending the recursion. However, setting the scrollbar to a negative value causes it to check for equality *before* fixing up the value and storing it. It would see that eg, -1 != 0, decide to do the change (and thus eventually fire the event), fix up the value to 0 ... and save 0 on top of 0 and fire the changed event. Since UpdateScrollBars() is in the event's path, it always fires, and we end up in an infinite loop. Yuck.
